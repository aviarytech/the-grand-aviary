# Hotel Room Access Using Verifiable Credentials

## Project Overview
Our system revolutionizes hotel room access by implementing Verifiable Credentials as digital room keys. We've created a seamless experience where guests receive a secure digital credential upon booking confirmation, replacing traditional key cards. Built on Extrimian's ID Connect platform, our solution combines security and convenience in a modern access control system.

## Core Components

### Room Access Credential Issuer
The credential issuer serves as the cornerstone of our system, activating automatically when a hotel reservation is confirmed. It generates a unique Verifiable Credential that contains the essential details of the guest's stay, including their room number and duration of access. Using ID Connect's issuer functionality, we ensure each credential is cryptographically secure and follows W3C standards.

### Access Verification System
At the heart of our room access system lies the verification component, which interfaces directly with the hotel's door control mechanisms. When a guest presents their credential at their room, our verification system quickly validates the credential using ID Connect's API. The API handles all aspects of verification, including status checking, providing a robust security layer while maintaining fast response times for a smooth guest experience.

## Technical Implementation
Our solution is built entirely on Extrimian's ID Connect platform, ensuring compliance with W3C Verifiable Credentials standards. The platform's API manages the complexity of status checking and verification, allowing us to focus on creating an intuitive user experience. This integration provides a solid foundation for secure credential management while simplifying the technical architecture.
